## Unit Tests

The cheapest and the easiest to implement, they test if a function works as expected to work.

## Integration Tests

 This test if a express works with a database, or if a function works with another function, and how this connection between them works

## Automation Tests

Or UI tests, this envolves testing real life cenarios, run the browser and control the browser to if the expected behavior on the web is correct, you can have humans doing this or you can have robots or code that you write, that runs this tests for you.

All those tests have their usecases but have their cons and pros.
